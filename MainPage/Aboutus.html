    <div class="container">     <h2> a)	WHO ARE WE</h2></div>

    <div class="container"> 
        We are students from the University of Sydney. In our subject work, we need to build such a barter trading website. Perhaps we are not proficient in some of them, but we dare to innovate and actively modify them. 
    </div>


    <div class="container">           <h2>b)	CAPABILITIES OF OUR PLATFORM</h2></div>

    <div class="container"> 
        Our platform will provide barter services, and consumers will be able to publish the goods they want to sell on the website in exchange for the other items published by other consumers in a non monetary way. We are committed to bringing the original trading mode of "exchange" into people's lives, and making people feel novel through trading different from only the amount of money.
    </div>

    <div class="container"> 
        We will apply our privacy term to the whole platform. If you need to know, please move to PRIVACY
